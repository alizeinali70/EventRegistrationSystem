1- .Net 3.1
2- Microsoft SQL Server
3- Entity Framework

### Contributing
```
All work on the C# and Visual Studio compiler happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors 
send pull requests which go through the same review process.
```
### How it works:
```
this Application is working with SQL Database and EntityFramework.
So we decided to write a useful app that managers have the ability to do high level jobs when ever they are not in Office.
```
